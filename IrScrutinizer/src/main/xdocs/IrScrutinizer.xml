<title>Introduction</title>
<p>
IrScrutinizer is a powerful program for capturing, generating, analyzing,
importing, and
exporting of infrared (IR) signals. For capturing and sending IR signals
several different hardware sensors and senders are supported. IR Signals can be
imported not only by capturing from one of the supported hardware
sensors (among others: IrWidget, Global Caché, Command Fusion, and Arduino), but also from a
number of different file formats (among others: Lirc, Wave, CML, Pronto Classic and
professional, RMDU (partially), and different text based formats; not only from
files, but also from the clipboard, from URLs, and from file hierarchies), as
well as the Internet IR Databases by Global Caché and by IRDB. Imported signals
can be decoded, analyzed, edited, and visualized. A collection of
IR signal can thus be assembled and edited, and finally exported in one of the
many supported formats.  In addition, the program contains the powerful
IrpMaster IR-renderer, which means that almost all IR protocols known to the
Internet community can be generated.</p>

<p>Written in Java (with the exception of three native libraries), most of the
functionality of the program is available on every Java platform. The native
libraries (DecodeIR and RXTX) are presently available for 32- and 64-bit
versions of Windows, Linux (x86, amd-64, arm version 7), and MacOsX, and can with moderate effort be compiled for other
platforms. (The library DevSlashLirc is available (and meaningful!) for Linux only.)</p>
<p>
For someone with knowledge in the problem domain of IR signals and
their parameterization, this program is believed to be simple to
use. This knowledge is assumed from the reader. Other can acquire that
knowledge either from the <a
 href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">JP1
Wiki</a>
or, e.g., <a href="http://www.sbprojects.com/knowledge/ir/index.php">this
link</a>.</p>

<p>Note that screen shots are included as illustrations only; they may not
depict the current program completely accurately. They come from different
versions of  the program, using different platforms (Linux and Windows), and
using different "look and feels".</p>

<p>The present document is written more for completeness than for
easy accessibility. For an easier introduction, see

<section>
<title>Background</title>
<p>
In 2011 I wrote an IR signal "engine"
called <a href="IrpMaster.html">IrpMaster</a>. It can also be invoked as a
command line program. Then a program
called <a href="IrMaster.html">IrMaster</a> was released, which among other things
constitutes a user friendly GUI front end to IrpMaster. The present program,
IrScrutinizer, is also based on IrpMaster, and adds functionality from
IrMaster, in particular the possibility to collect IR signals, a vastly
improved import and export facility, and edit collections of IR commands.

IrScrutizer almost completely replaces IrMaster.
The final version was released in Febrary 2014, slightly ironically called version
1.0.0.  No further development is planned.</p>

<title>Installation</title>
<section>
    <title>Download</title>
    <p>The latest official release is always <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/harctoolboxbundle/releases/latest">available here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, there are <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/harctoolboxbundle/releases/tag/ci-build">continuous integration builds</a>,
    at least most of the time. These are build from a snapshot of the current sources. Because of this, they are more likely to contain bugs,
    or even to be outright useless.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
<title>General</title>
<p>IrScrutinizer, and all but two of its third-party additions, are written in Java,
which means that it should run on every computer with a modern Java installed;
Windows, Linux (including Raspberry Pi), Macintosh, etc. Java 8 or later is required. The
exception are DecodeIR and the native part of RXTX, which are written in C++
and C respectively, and invoked as shared library
    (<code>.dll</code> in Windows, <code>.so</code> in Linux, <code>.jnilib</code> or <code>.dylib</code> in Mac OS X).
    For Linux, there is also the <em>DevSlashLirc</em> library.
    If DecodeIR, RXTX, or DevSlashLirc are
not available on for a particular platform it is not a major problem, as most parts of IrScrutinizer will
work fine without it; just the DecodeIR-related functions, the serial
hardware access, or the access to certain hardware will be unavailable.</p>

<p>In all versions, IrScrutinizer behave civilized, in that the installation
directory is not written to, and thus can be read-only as soon as the installation has taken place.
</p>
<p>As of version 1.3, there are six different way of installing the program, described next.</p>
</section>
<section><title>Windows</title>
<p>First make sure that the current Java is installed.</p>
<p>Download the <a
href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/harctoolboxbundle/releases/latest">Window setup
file</a> and double click it. Select any installation
directory you like; suggested is <code>C:\Program Files\IrScrutinizer</code>,
unless you can not install with administrator rights. Unless
reason to do so, create the start menu folder, and the desktop
icon. If administrator rights are present, the recommended installation location is in a subdirectory of <code>Program Files</code>.
If not, installing is still possibly, using any installation directory writeable by the current user.
IrScrutinizer can now be started from <code>Start -> IrScrutinizer ->
IrScrutinizer</code>, or from the desktop icon.</p>

<p>If desired, the installer will associate <code>.girr</code> files with the program, allowing them to
be opened by double clicking them.</p>

<p>The installer will also install the command line program <a href="IrpMaster.html">IrpMaster</a>,
which can be called as <code>irpmaster</code> from a so-called DOS box.</p>

<p>To uninstall, select the uninstall option from the Start menu. Very pedantic
people may like to delete the properties file too, see <a href="#Properties">properties</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <title>AppImage for 64-bit Linux</title>
    <p>An <a href="http://appimage.org/">AppImage</a> is a distribution consisting of
    one large monolithic executable application that is downloaded, made executable, and run, without any
    installation in classic sense. At this moment, only 64-bit x86 Linux is supported, but it is believed
to run on all modern, 64-bit x86 Linux distrubutions. Just download
    <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/harctoolboxbundle/releases/latest">IrScrutinizer-x86_64.AppImage</a>,
    make executable, and double click (alternativelly, start from the command line).
    Possibly contrary to the AppImage philosophy, this appimage does not come with its own Java,
    but requires it to be installed separatly. (Otherwise it would have been 10 times larger.)</p>

    <section>
        <title>Serial device access</title>
        <p>To access serial devices, including "serial" devices connected over USB, most current Linuxes
            require the current user to be a member of the group <code>dialout</code>, in some cases (e.g. Fedora) also
            the group <code>lock</code>. To grant user <code>$USER</code> this membership, typically a
            command like
            <code>sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER</code>, and/or <code>sudo usermod -aG lock $USER</code> is used.
        </p>
        <p>Do not run this program as root.</p>
    </section>
</section>
      <section>
	<title>Mac OS X app</title>
        <p>As opposed to Linux and Windows, the "JDK" (Java Development Kit) needs to be installed on MacOS X, not just "Java" (JRE).</p>
<p>Download the  <a
    href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/downloads/IrScrutinizer-app.zip">compressed app</a>.
    Uncompress it by double clicking. Opening it will show an app, and a few documention files.
    The app can just be dragged to the desktop, to the tray, to "Applications" or any other location the user prefers.
    IrScrutinizer now behaves like any other app in Mac OS X.</p>

    <!--p>(The previous version was instead distrubuted as a <a
    href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/downloads/IrScrutinizer.dmg.zip">compressed disk image</a>.
    This should be uncompressed it by double clicking, and mounted by double clicking the resulting file.
    A mounted disk image "IrScrutinizer" will appear on the desktop. Then proceed as above.)</p-->

    <p>To unistall, just move the app to the trash.</p>
    <p>The command line program <a href="IrpMaster.html">IrpMaster</a> is not supported in this mode.
    (For this, the <a href="#Generic+Binary">generic binary</a> distribution has to be used.)    </p>
      </section>

<section><title>Generic Binary</title>
<p>The generic binary version consists of all the java classes packed in one executable jar file,
together with supporting files, like all the compiled shared libraries for the different
operating systems Linux (x64-32, x86-64, armv7), Windows (x86, 32 and 64 bits), and Mac. It can be used on all those systems. (In other environments, the
shared libraries may be compiled with moderate effort.)</p>

<p>The generic binary distribution can be used whenever using the
rpm/setup.exe/app installation is not possible, not up-to-date, or not desired.</p>

<p>First make sure that the current Java is installed.</p>

<p>To install, unpack in an empty directory of your choice, suggested is
    <code>/usr/local/irscrutinizer</code>. Inspect the wrapper <code>irscrutinizer.sh</code>, and
    make changes if necessary.</p>

<p>It is recommended to make links from a directory in the path to the
wrapper script, e.g.</p>
<source>
ln -s /usr/local/irscrutinizer/irscrutinizer.sh /usr/local/bin/irscrutinizer
ln -s /usr/local/irscrutinizer/irscrutinizer.sh /usr/local/bin/irpmaster
</source>
<p>If your system natively supports the RXTX, you should preferably use that. See
    the comments in the wrapper <code>irscrutinizer.sh</code>.</p>

    <p>The JNI libraries <code>libDecodeIR.so</code>/<code>DecodeIR.dll</code>/<code>libDecodeIR.jnilib</code> are contained in the
    distribution and should be found by the program in the installed location.</p>

    <p>The desktop file <code>irscrutinizer.desktop</code> should, if desired, be
    installed in <code>/usr/local/share/applications</code> alternatively
    <code>~/.local/share/applications</code>.</p>

    <p>The program can now be started either as a desktop program, or by typing <code>irscrutinizer</code> on the command line.
    Also the command line program <a href="IrpMaster.html">IrpMaster</a> can be started
    by the command <code>irpmaster</code>. It is also possible to start the program by double clicking
    on the jar file. In case this brings up the archive manager, the desktop needs to be taught
    to open executable jar files with the "java" application. For this, select a jar file the file browser,
    select the properties, and select "java" as the application to "open with". (The details might vary.)</p>

    <p>On Linux, it is general necessary to check, and possibly fix, the
        <a href="#Serial+device+access">access to the serial devices</a>. The previously mentioned
        wrapper does this.</p>

        <p>On Gnome-like desktops, by copying the file <code>girr.xml</code> to the system's data base of
        known file types, <code>*.girr</code> files can be opened in IrScrutinizer by double click.
        For this, follow <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/mime.html.en">this
        description</a>.</p>

<p>To uninstall, just delete the files. Some may like to delete the <a href="#Properties">properties file</a> too.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <title>Fedora Linux</title>
    <p>Fedora rpm packages are
        available for the now obsolete version 1.1.3.</p>
        <p>To install, the command <code>sudo dnf install harctoolbox harctoolbox-doc</code> should be issued in a terminal window.
        This will install IrScrutinizer as a desktop program, as well as the command line
        commands <code>irscrutinizer</code> and <code>irpmaster</code>.
        To uninstall, use the command  <code>sudo dnf erase harctoolbox harctoolbox-doc</code>.</p>
        <p>Unfortunatelly, the packaging contains a few semi-serious problems. These are reported,
            but stay unfixed (since over a year).
            Fedora users are recommended instead to use AppImage or the generic binary package.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <title>Source distribution</title>
    <p>Compiling the sources is covered in the <a href="#Appendix.+Building+from+sources">Appendix</a>.
    This allows to install the different components in a way compliant with e.g. the installation by the Gnu Autotools,
    normally in subdirectories of <code>/usr/local</code>.</p>
</section>
</section>

<section>
<title>Concepts</title>
<p>For anyone familiar with the problem domain, this
program is believed to be intuitive and easy to use. Almost all user interface
elements have tool-help texts. Different panes have their own pop-up help. In what follows, we will not attempt to
explain every detail of the user interface, but rather concentrate on the
concepts. Furthermore, it is possible that new elements and functionality has
been implemented since the documentation was written.</p>
<p>
This program does not disturb the user with a number of
annoying, often <a
 href="http://www.bengt-martensson.de/misc/modal.html">modal</a>,
pop ups, but directs errors, warnings, and status outputs to the <em>console window</em>,
taking up the lower third of the main window. This
window is re-sizeable. There is a context menu for the
console, accessible by pressing the right mouse button in it.</p>
<p>In the upper row, there are six pull-down menus, named File,
Edit, Actions, Options, Tools, and Help. Their usage is believed to be mainly
self explanatory, with some the exceptions.</p>

<p>Options to the program are in general found in the Options menu, or its
subordinate menus. Some parameters for particular export formats are found in
the sub-panes of the "Export" pane. Also the hardware configuring panes contain
user parameters.</p>

<p>
The main window is composed of seven sub panes denoted
by "Scrutinize signal" (for processing single signal), "Scrutinize remote" (for
collecting several signals to one "remote"), "Generate" (generates IR signal
from protocol name and parameters), "Import", "Export",
"Sending Hardware", and "Capturing Hardware"
respectively. These panels will be discussed in Section <a
href="#GUI+Elements+walkthrough">GUI Elements walk through</a></p>
    </section>

<section><title>Analyzing a single IR Sequence or IR Signal</title>
<p>The pane "Scrutinize Signal" is devoted to the analysis of one single IR
sequence.</p>

<p>To capture IR Sequences from a hardware sensor, first set it up and open it,
see Section <a href="#Capturing+Hardware">Capturing Hardware</a>. An IR Sequence
is captured by pressing the "Capture" button, and sending an IR signal to the
selected hardware. Note that the hardware captures an <em><a
href="Glossary.html#IrSequence">IR Sequence</a></em>, not an <a href="Glossary.html#IrSignal">IR Signal</a>. It
consists of an (sometimes empty) <a href="Glossary.html#StartSequence">start sequence</a>,
an unknown number of <a href="Glossary.html#RepeatSequence">repeat sequences</a>, and
sometimes an <a href="Glossary.html#EndingSequence">ending sequence</a>.</p>
    </section>

<section><title>Adding new export formats</title>
<p>Only a few of the many export formats are  defined in the main Java code,
the rest are defined in files in the directory  <code>exportformats.d</code>,
located in the root of the install directory. By adding a file here,
the user can simply add his/her own export formats according to own
needs. An export format consists of a number of properties, together
with a small "program" written in the transformation language XSLT,
for transforming a Girr-XML-tree to the desired text format.</p>

<p>The rest of this section documents the format of these files, and is
supposed to be read only when needed. Fundamental knowledge of XML and
<a href="Glossary.html#XSLT">XSLT transformations</a> are assumed.</p>

<section><title>Format of the files in <code>exportformats.d</code></title>
<p>The file is an XML file read without validation. The syntax and semantics
are believed to be essentially self explaining, or clear from the
examples already in there. An export format is
packed in an element of type <code>exportformat</code>. It contains
the following attributes:</p>
<dl>
<dt>name</dt><dd>Text string used for identifying the format.</dd>
<dt>extension</dt><dd>Text string denoting preferred file extension (not including period)
of generated files.</dd>
<dt>multiSignal</dt><dd>Boolean (value: true and false). Denotes if
several signals can be represented in one export, or only one.</dd>
<dt>simpleSequence</dt><dd>Boolean, (values <code>true</code> of
<code>false</code>). If true, the export really describes an <a
href="Glossary.html#IrSequence">sequence</a> rather than am <a
href="Glossary.html#IrSignal">signal</a> (with intro-, repeat- , and
ending-sequences), therefore the user must explictly state a particular number
of repetitions for an export.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The element contains a single child element, namely the XSLT
transformation, which is an element of type
    <code>xsl:stylesheet</code>, with attributes as in the examples.</p>
<p>The task of the transformaton is to transform a Girr XML DOM tree in the <a

    <title>Properties</title>
<p>Under Windows, the properties are stored in
<code><![CDATA[%LOCALAPPDATA%\IrScrutinizer\IrScrutinizer.properties.xml]]></code> using Windows
Vista and later (on my Windows 7 system, this is <code>%HOME%\AppData\Local\IrScrutinizer\IrScrutinizer.properties.xml</code>), otherwise in
<code>%APPDATA%\IrScrutinizer\IrScrutinizer.properties.xml</code>. Using other operating
systems, it is stored according to the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/index.html">FreeDesktop specification</a>.
Per default, this is <code>$HOME/.config/IrScrutinizer/properties.xml</code>. It is
not deleted by  un-install. (If weird problems appear, for example after an update, try
deleting this file. For this, there is a command line option <code>--nuke-properties</code> that can be used to
conveniently delete the present property file, without knowing its exact name.)

<title>GUI Elements walk through</title>
<section>
<title>The "Scrutinize signal" pane</title>
<p>This panel is devoted to the analysis of a <em>single <a href="Glossary.html#IrSignal">IR
signal</a></em> or <a href="Glossary.html#IrSequence">IR sequence</a>. A (single)
signal is either read from hardware using the "Capture" button (requires that
the capturing hardware has been set on the "Capturing Hardware" pane), imported
from a file (using the context menu in the data window, or through File ->
Import -> Import as single sequence), or pasted from the clipboard. Also, some
other panes can transfer data to this pane.

The button "Capt. (cont.)" a tread is started, that continously captures signals
from the hardware. Only the last signal is kept.

For text
import, the signal can be in either Pronto Hex format, raw format (indicated by
a leading "+"-sign), or in the <a href="Glossary.html#UEILearnedFormat">UEI learned format</a>. The signal is printed in the
data window, in the preferred text format, which can be selected from the
options menu. The text representation may be edited (assuming sufficient
knowledge!), after which the edited signal is analyzed and plotted again by
pressing the "Scrutinize" button. The signal may be sent to the sending
hardware by pressing the "Transmit" button.</p>

<p>The plot can be horizontally zoomed by pressing the left mouse button and dragging.
Printing and exported as graph are presently not implemented.</p>

<p>The menu entry Actions -> Enter test signal (or its accelerator, the F9
key) enters a test signal.</p>

<p>Using context menus, the result can be sent to the clipboard or saved
to a file. The menu entry "clone plot" makes a clone of the plot.
    This can be used for comparing with subsequent plots.</p>

    <p>
Note that transforming the signal between different formats may introduce
rounding errors. In rare cases, this may causing decoding
to fail.
</p>
<p>A Girr file can be dropped on the text- or plot windows. This will display
    the concatenation of the signals in the file.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>The "Scrutinize remote" pane</title>
<p>This panel is devoted to the capturing/import/editing of a collection of IR
signals, called  "a remote" in the sequel. The panel contains two sub-panels:
for <a href="Glossary.html#ParametricIRSignal">parametric signals</a> and for <a href="Glossary.html#RawIRSignal">non-parametric, "raw", signals</a>.</p>

<p>A "parametric" signal is determined by its protocol name, and the values of
the protocol's parameters. A "raw" signal is determined by its timing pattern,
and its modulation frequency. It may have one or many decodes, or
none. Nevertheless, by definition, a raw signal is determined by its timing,
not the decodes.
</p>

<p>In both cases, the sub panes consists of tables with a number of
columns. Every signal takes up a row in the table. The content of the
individual cells (with the exception of its number and date) can be
individually edited, like in a spreadsheet program.</p>

<p>In both tables, the right mouse button opens a context menu containing a
number of ways to manipulate the table, its view, or the data contained
therein. By enabling the row selector, the rows can be sorted along any of the
present columns. </p>

<p>Clicking a row with the middle mouse button selects that row, and transmits
it using the currently selected sending hardware.</p>

<p>To capture IR signals, first configure the hardware using the <a
href='#The+"Capturing+HW"+pane'>capturing hardware</a> pane. Next press the
Capture button. The program will now run the  capturing in a separate thread, so
the user just have to press the buttons of the remote. The signals will be
received, interpreted, decoded, and entered on subsequent lines in the selected
table (raw or parameterized). The capture thread will continue until the
captured button is pressed again. (Note that this is completely different from
the capture button on the "Scrutinize signal" panel.) The user may mix captures
with other activities, like entering information (name, comments,...) in the
table.</p>

<p>The export button exports the content of the currently selected table (raw
or parameterized) according to the currently selected export format.</p>

<p>A Girr file can be dropped on the parameter as well as the raw table, which will
import the contained signals.</p>

<p>The menu entry Actions -> Enter test signal (or its accelerator, the F9
key) enters a test signal, either as parametric signal, or as a raw signal.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>The "Generate" pane</title>
<p>In the upper part of this pane, an  IR protocol is selected, identified by
name, and the parameters D ("device", in almost all protocols), S
("sub-device", not in all protocols), F ("function", also called
command number or OBC, present in almost all protocols), as well as T, <a href="Glossary.html#toggle">"toggle"</a>
(in general 0 or 1, only in a few protocols). These number can be entered as
decimal numbers, or, by prepending "0x", as hexadecimal numbers.</p>

<p>By pressing "Generate", the signal is computed, and the middle window is
filled with a textual representation, in the form selected by Options -> Output
Text Format.</p>

<p>The Export button initiates an export to a file format selected by the <a
href="#The+Export+pane">Export pane</a>. The three lower buttons transfer the signal(s) to the
scrutinize signal panel, the raw remote table, or the parameterized panel.</p>

<section><title>Accessing a number of different parameter values</title><p>
For the export and the transfer to the "scrutinize remote" tables, not only a
single parameter value can be selected, but whole sets. The complete syntax and
semantics is given <a href="IrpMaster.html#Iterating+over+input+parameter+ranges">in the
IrpMaster documentation</a>, we here just mention that e.g. 12:34 means all
numbers between 12 and 34 (inclusive), and * denotes all possible values (as defined by the
protocol's <a href="Glossary.html#IRPNotation">IRP notation)</a>.

<section>
<title>The Import pane</title>
<!--p>The import feature is among the most advance parts of IrScrutinizer.</p-->

<p>The import pane allows for selective import of collection of <a
href="Glossary.html#Command">IR commands</a>. Both Internet data bases and
file formats are supported. Import can take place from local files or even file
hierarchies, from the clipboard, or from Internet URLs.</p>

<p>There are a number of elements common to most of the sub-panes, so these
will be described next.</p>

<p>For file/URL based imports, there is a text field, named File or
File/URL. For the latter case, an URL (like
<code>http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/yamaha/RX-V995</code>) can be
entered, for subsequent import without downloading to a local disc. By pressing
the "..."-Button, a file selector allows the selection of a local file. For
files and URLs, the "Edit/Browse" button allows to examine the selected
file/URL with the operating system's standard command.</p>

<p>Several of the formats (the one based on text files, but not on XML
    (which carries its own character set declaration) allow the
user to select the character set to be used for the import to be selected.
    This option is found as <code>Options -> Import options -> Character Set...</code>
</p>

<p>Most of the file based importers support dropping a compatible file
    from the GUI on the import window.</p>

<p>If the option "<code>Open ZIP files</code>" (accessible from <code>Options
-> Import</code>) is
selected, zip files can  be selected, opened, and unzipped "on the fly",
without the need for the user to unzip to intermediate files.</p>

<p>When pressing one of the "Load", "Load File/URL", or "Load from clipboard"
button, the selected information is downloaded, and presented in the format of
an expandable tree. By placing the
mouse cursor over a command, additional information, like <a href="Glossary.html#Decode">decode</a>, is presented. A single
command can be selected by mouse click, a sequence of adjacent commands by
shift-click, a subset of not necessarily adjacent commands be selected by
Ctrl-click, as usual from most GUIs. A single selected command can be transferred to the
"Scrutinize signal" pane by pressing "Import signal". The "Import all" ("Import
selection") button
transfers all commands (the selected commands) to the "Scrutinize remote" pane,
sub-pane "Parametric remote" (without overwriting already present commands), while the buttons "Import all/raw" and "Import
selected/raw" transfer to the sub-pane "Raw remote".</p>

<p>The key "Transmit selected" transmits the (single) selected signal to the
	selected sending hardware.</p>

        <p>The file based import formats allow a file to be "dropped" with the mouse on the main window.</p>

<section><title>Global Caché Database</title>
<p>Global Caché maintains a <a href="http://irdatabase.globalcache.com/">data base
of IR signals</a>, made available free of charge. "Contains over 100,000
Infrared codes for over 2,000 different remotes from over 500 manufacturers".
To use from IrScrutinizer, an API Key has be be retrieved. This can be done from
a Facebook, Google, or Yahoo account. After pressing the "APIKey" button, the
API key is entered in the pop-up window. It is subsequently saved to the
program's properties.
To use, first select <code>Select me to load</code> to load the list of the manufacturers.
Then select, in order, a manufacturer, a <a
								    href="Glossary.html#DeviceType">device
type</a>, and a <a href="Glossary.html#setupCode">setup code</a>, the latter possibly by
trial-and-error.</p>
<p>This data base is no longer maintained; replaced by the "Control Tower data base", described next.</p>
	</section>

        <section>
            <title>Global Caché's Control Tower data base</title>
            <p>This is the new data base from Global Caché. Unfortunately,
                non-premium users are not allowed to download codes using the API.
                For this reason, the program really only "browses" the data base.</p>

            <p>To use its codes, log in with the browser (the "Web site" button goes to the home page),
                and have the code set mailed in CSV format (press "Send Code Set").
                The mail received can be imported by the import text pane, raw subpane, Name col. = 1, Raw signal col = 2 (or 3),
                Field separator: comma.
            </p>

<section><title>The IRDB Database</title>
<p><a href="http://irdb.tk">IRDB</a> is "one of the largest crowd-sourced,
manufacturer-independent databases of infrared remote control codes on the web,
and aspiring to become the most comprehensive and most accurate one."</p>

<p>To use, first select <code>Select me to load</code> to load the list of the manufacturers. Then select,
in order, a manufacturer, a <a href="Glossary.html#DeviceType">device
type</a>, and a <a href="Glossary.html#IrProtocol">protocol</a>/parameter
combination, the latter possibly by trial-and-error.</p>

<p>Pressing the "Load all" button transfers all present protocol/parameters
combinations to the tree.</p>
	</section>
<section><title>Girr (the native format of IrScrutinizer)</title>
<p>The <a href="Glossary.html#Girr">Girr format</a> is the native format of
IrScrutinizer. The importer is capable of importing directory hierarchies.</p>
	</section>

<section><title>Lirc</title>
<p>The <a href="Glossary.html#Lirc">Lirc</a> import feature is based upon <a
href="Jirc.html">Jirc</a>, which is basically a subset of Lirc translated into Java.
The Lirc importer can even import a file
system hierarchy by selecting the top directory as File/URL. (Importing the
entire lirc.org database with over 100000 commands takes around 1 minute and 1GB
of memory.)</p>
	</section>

        <section>
            <title>CML</title>
            <p>The CML format is the format used by the RTI Integration Designer software.
Many CML files are available in Internet, in particular on
                <a href="http://files.remotecentral.com/rti/index.html">RemoteCentral</a>.
                Particularly noteworthy is the <a href="http://files.remotecentral.com/collection/66-1/index.html">"megalist" by Glackowitz</a>.
                IrScrutinizer can import these files to its import tree, making every remote a nodes in the tree.
                Note that there is no need to unzip such a file; IrScrutinizer will unzip it on the fly.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Command Fusion</title>
            <p>The native format that Command Fusion uses, file extension <code>.cfir</code>, can be imported here.</p>
        </section>
<section><title>RemoteMaster</title>
<p>The <a href="Glossary.html#JP1">JP1 community</a> has a large data base of parametric IR
commands. IrScrutinizer has support for importing RMDU files for
RemoteMaster. Unfortunately, the signals are stored as parameters for so-called
executors, with sometimes different parameterization ("hex", "efc") than the IRP
protocols. Translating these files to one of the known protocol/parameter
format is nothing but straightforward. It uses protocol information contained
in protocols.ini. IrScrutinizer reads this file, and can do some computations,
for example on NEC1 protocols, but not on all protocols.</p>

<p>For signals without recognized protocol name, importing
as raw signals, or to "Scrutinize signal", is not possible. However, they can
always be imported as parametric signals, possibly for manual edit.</p>
	</section>

<section><title>Pronto Classic (CCF format)</title>
<p>Many <a href="Glossary.html#ccfFileFormat">Pronto CCF files</a> are available in Internet,
in particular by <a
href="http://files.remotecentral.com/pronto/index.html">Remote
Central</a>. IrScrutinizer can read in these files to its import tree, even
preserving the Pronto "devices" as nodes in the tree.</p>

<!--p>Unfortunately, the <a href="Glossary.html#Tonto">Tonto library</a> used
produces the warning message <code>Error loading JComm JNI library</code>. This message
should be ignored.</p-->
	</section>

<section><title>Pronto Prof. (XCF format)</title>
<p><a href="Glossary.html#xcfFileFormat">Pronto Professional XCF</a> files are
found for example at <a
href="http://files.remotecentral.com/prontopro/index.html">Remote
Central</a>. IrScrutinizer can read in these files to its import tree, even
preserving the Pronto "devices" as nodes in the tree.</p>
<p>This is not extensively tested.</p>
	</section>

<section><title>ICT IrScope format</title>
<p>The ICT format, introduced by Kevin Timmerman's  IrScope, contains the timing pattern,
the modulation frequency, and optionally a name ("note") of one or many IR signals.</p>
	</section>

<section><title>Text format</title>
<p>In the Internet, there are a lot of information in table-like formats, like
Excel, describing the IR commands of certain devices. IrScrutinizer has some
possibilities of importing these &mdash; after exporting them to a text format,
like tab separated values (tsv) or comma separated values.</p>

<section><title>Raw</title>
<p>The sub-pane allows for the parsing of text files separated by a certain
characters, like commas, semicolons, or tabs. The separating characters is
selected in the "Field separator" combo box. The column to be used as name is
entered in the "Name col." combo box, while the data to be interpreted either as
raw data or CCF format, is entered  in the "Raw signal col.". If the "... and
subsequent columns" is selected, all subsequent columns are added to the data.</p>
	  </section>

<section><title>Raw, line-based</title>
<p>This pane tries to interpret a line-based file as a number of named IR
commands, using heuristics.</p>
	  </section>

<section><title>Parameterized</title>
<p>The sub-pane allows for the parsing of text files separated by a certain
characters, like commas, semicolons, or tabs. The separating characters is
selected in the "Field separator" combo box. The column to be used as name is
entered in the "Name col." combo box, while protocol name and the parameters D,
S, and F are entered in their respective combo boxes. They are parsed in the
number base selected.</p>
	  </section>
	</section>

<section><title>Wave</title>
<p>This pane imports and analyzes wave files, considered to represent IR
signals. The outcome of the analysis (sample frequency, sample size, the number
of channels, and in the case of two channels, the number of sample times the
left and right channels are in phase or anti-phase) is printed to the
console.</p>
	</section>

        <section>
            <title>IrTrans</title>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.irtrans.com">IrTrans</a>' configuration files (<code>.rem</code>) can be imported here.</p>
        </section>
</section>

<section>
<title>The Export pane</title>
<p>Using the export pane, export files can be generated,  allowing
other programs to use the computed results. Single signals (from the
"Scrutinize signal" pane), collections of signals (from the "Scrutinize remote"
pane), or generated signals can be exported. Exports can be generated in a
number of different formats. Some (Girr and text) can contain both
the Pronto format and the "raw" format (timings in
microseconds, positive for pulses, negative for gaps), as well as other
formats. These formats, together with Wave, Lirc, and Pronto Classic, are
built-in in the program. However, it is possible to define new
export formats by extending a configuration file, see <a
    href="#Adding+new+export+formats">Adding new export formats</a>.</p>
<p>The file
names of the exports are either user selected from a file
selector, or, if "Automatic file names" has been selected,
automatically generated.</p>

<p>The export is performed by pressing the one of the Export buttons. The "..."-marked
button allows for manually selecting the export directory. It is recommended to
create a new, empty directory for the exports. The just-created export file can
be immediately inspected by pressing the "Open last file"-button, which will open
it in the "standard way" of the operating system.
  (Also available on the actions menu.)
(Girr exports become a special treatment in order not to invoke another
    instance of the IrScrutinizer. They are copied to a temporary <code>.txt</code> file.)
    The "Open" button
similarly opens the operating systems standard directory browser (Windows
Explorer, Konquistador, Nautilus,...) on the export directory.</p>

<p>Some export formats (presently Wave, mode2, and Lintronic)
    export an <a href="Glossary.html#IrSequence">IR sequence</a> rather than an
<a href="Glossary.html#IrSignal">IR signal</a> (consisting of an intro sequence, an repetition sequence (to be
included 0 or more times), and an (most often empty) ending
sequence). When using these formats, the number of repetition sequences to include
can be selected.</p>
<p>The character set used for the export can be selected through <code>Options -> Export options -> Character set...</code>
            Note however that this makes sense only for text based formats, including XML.</p>

<p>Some export formats have some more parameters, configured in sub panes.
    These will be discussed in the context of the containing formats.</p>

<p>The formats presently implemented will be described next, in alphabetical order.</p>

    and <a href="http://harctoolbox.org/Infrared4Arduino.html">Infrared4Arduino</a>.
    As the name suggests, the <a href="Glossary.html#RawIrSignal">raw form of the signals</a> are used.
    </p></section>

    <section><title>Arduino/Infrared4Arduino</title>
    <p>Generates a similar C++ sketch for the Arduino as in the raw case, but tries to
        use the <a href="Glossary.html#ParametricIRSignal">parametric form</a> whenever possible, i.e.,
        whenever the protocol is one that can be generated by the underlying infrared library. This version supports
        <a href="http://harctoolbox.org/Infrared4Arduino.html">Infrared4Arduino</a> only.

    <section>
        <title>Girr</title>
        <p>The program's native format, based on XML. Very flexible and
            extensible. Can contain information like the raw format, CCF format, UEI
            learned format, and the Global Caché sendir format. <a href="Girr.html">Documentation</a>.
            There are some extra parameters that can be configured in subpanes, described next:</p>
        <section>
            <title>The Girr sub-pane</title>
            <p>A style sheet can be selected to be linked in into the exported Girr
                file. The type of style file (presently xslt and css) can also be selected.</p>

            <p>"Fat form raw" can be selected; this means that the raw signals are not given
                as a text string of alternating positive and negative numbers, but the
                individual flashes and gaps are enclosed into own XML elements. This can be
                advantageous if generating XML mainly for the purpose of transforming to other formats.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>The sendir sub-pane</title>
            <p>The <a href="Glossary.html#sendir">Global Caché sendir</a> format is
                optionally included within the Girr and the text format. It
                requires a module number and a connector
                number. Also, it is possible to generate the compressed form of sendir. This can be enabled by selecting

<title>The "Sending HW" pane</title>
<p>The sub-panes of this pane allows for the selection and configuration
of the deployed IR sending/capturing hardware.</p>

<p>Note that there is exactly one <em>selected device</em>, corresponding to the the selected sub-pane of the "Sending HW" pane.
This device may be opened or not. An opened device may be selected or not. There may be more than opened device.</p>

<p>The currently selected ports etc. are stored in the properties, thereby
remembered between sessions. So, for future sessions, only opening the
preferred device is necessary. </p>

<section>
<title>The "Global Caché" pane.</title>
<p>IrScrutinizer automatically detects alive Global Caché units in the local area
network, using the <a href="Glossary.html#AMXBeacon">AMX Beacon</a>. However, this may take
up to 60 seconds, and is not implemented in very old firmware. Using the "Add"
button, the IP address/name of older units can be entered manually.</p>

<p>The "Browse" button points the user's web browser to the selected unit.</p>

<p>The reported type and firmware version serves to verify that the
communication is working.</p>

<p>"Stop IR"-Button allows the interruption of ongoing transmission,
possibly initiated from another source.</p>

<p>The user can select one of the thus available Global Caché units, together with
IR-module and IR-port (see <a
 href="http://www.globalcache.com/files/docs/API-GC-100.pdf">the
Global Caché API specification</a> for the exact meaning of these
terms).</p>
	</section>
	  <section>
	    <title>The "Lirc" pane</title>
<p>To be fully usable for IrScrutinizer, the Lirc server has to be extended to be
able to cope with CCF signal not residing in the local data base, but sent from
a client like IrScrutinizer, thus mimicking the function of e.g. a
Global Caché. The needed modification ("patch") is in detail described <a
    href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/lirc_ccf.xml">here</a>, sources <a href="https://sourceforge.net/u/bengtmartensson/lirc/ci/ccf/tree/">here</a>.
    However, even without
this patch, the configuration page can be used to send the predefined commands
(i.e. residing it its data base <code>lirc.conf</code>). It can be considered
as a GUI version of
the <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/irsend.html"><code>irsend</code>
command</a>.</p>
<p>The Lirc server needs to be started in network listening mode with
the <code>-l</code> or <code>--listen</code> option. Default TCP port is
8765.</p>

<p>When selecting the Lirc sub-pane, the therein selected Lircd is inquired for its version
    and its remotes. If successful, the "Remote" and
"Command" combo boxes should now be enabled. After selecting a remote and one
    of its command, it can be sent to the Lirc server by pressing the "Send" button.</p>


<p>After entering another IP-Address or name, and port (stay with 8765 unless a reason
to do otherwise), pressing the "Reload" button will update the Lirc server with its known remotes and their commands
    (however, not the version).
    </p>

    <p>Transmitting other signals to  Lirc works only if the Lirc server has the above described patch applied.</p>


<!--p>Due to Lirc's peculiar form of API stop command, the "Stop IR" command
presently does not work. See <a

            <title>/dev/lirc (Linux only)</title>
            <p>On Linux, so-called mode-2 capable IR hardware using the <code>/dev/lirc</code> device,
can be accessed directly, both for sending and receiving.
                When connected, and in some cases after loading suitable drivers, a device file <code>/dev/lirc</code><em>n</em>
                (for <em>n</em> = 0, 1, 2,...) will be created. Of course, this must be read- and/or writeable by the current user;
                in e.g. Fedora this is the case for member of the group <code>lirc</code>.</p>

                <p>After opening the device, its properties will be listed.
                    See the man page <a href="http://lirc.org/html/lirc.html">lirc(4)</a> for an explanation.</p>
                <p>Although not a priori impossible, to my knowledge no <code>/dev/lirc</code> device  implements frequency measurement.</p>

	    <title>The "IRTrans" pane</title>
<p>
The configuration of IRTrans is similar to Lirc, so it will be described
more briefly.</p>
<p>Enter IP name or -address and select an IR port (default "intern"). If the
Ethernet IRTrans contains an "IR Database" (which is a slightly misleading term
for an internal flash memory, that can be filled by the user), its commands can
be sent from this pane. By pressing the "Read" button, the known remotes and
commands are loaded, and the version of the IRTrans displayed. The selected
command can now be sent by the "Send" button. (However, this
functionality is otherwise not used by IrScrutinizer.)</p>

<p>The IRTrans
module is then accessed using the UDP text mode.</p>

<title>The "IrToy" Pane</title>
<p>Using this pane, the IrToy (version 2) can be used to transmit IR signals.
    The firmware versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, as well as the in-official "2.4" work.
    (These are identified by a version string like <code>V220</code> etc.)
    However, only version 2.2 has been exhaustively tested.</p>

    <p>The ending timeout for receive is 1.4 seconds, and cannot be changed. This is not optimal for most IR signal capture use cases.</p>

<section>
<title>The "CommandFusion" Pane</title>
<p>Using this pane, the CommandFusion learner can be used to transmit and capture IR signals.</p>
<p>After connecting the Command Fusion learner to a USB  port, select the the actual (virtual) serial port in
the combo box, pressing "Refresh" if necessary. "Open" the port
thereafter.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>The "Girs Client" (previously "Arduino") Pane</title>
<p>Using this pane, a <a href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/Girs.html">Girs server</a>
(e.g. running on an Arduino equipped with a suitable hardware) can be used to
transmit and capture IR signals. The server can be connected to a serial port,
or through Ethernet to the local area network, connected by a TCP socket. For the Arduino, the <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/AGirs">
sketch <code>GirsLite</code> (or <code>Girs</code>)</a>  can be
used.</p>

<p>The serial port may sometimes be finicky. Sometimes disconnecting and
reconnecting the device may help.</p>

<p>To use the device connected to a real or virtual serial port, select the port in
the combo box, pressing "Refresh" if necessary. "Open" the port
thereafter. The opening of LAN connected device is simliar.</p>

<p>Normally, the Girs server uses the Girs <code>analyze</code> command to capture IR signals,
which is normally deploying a non-demodulating sensor, providing a frequency measurement.
If this is not desired (for example when the non-demodulating sensor is missing),
selecting "Use receive for capture", instead the <code>receive</code> command will be used,
which normally uses a demodulating sensor. In this case, no frequency measurement will be produced,
    and instead the fallback frequency (selectable/changeable as Options -> Fallback frequency) will be used.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>The "Audio" Pane</title>
<p>
As additional "hardware sending device", IrScrutinizer can generate wave files, that can be
used to control IR-LEDs. This technique has been described many times in the
Internet the last few years, see for example <a
href="http://lirc.org/html/audio.html">this page</a> within the Lirc
project. The hardware consists of a pair of anti-parallel IR-LEDs, preferably
in series with a resistor. Theoretically, this corresponds to a full wave
rectification of a sine wave. Taking advantage of the fact that the LEDs are
conducting only for a the time when the forward voltage exceeds a certain
threshold, it is easy to see that this will generate an on/off signal with the
double frequency of the original sine wave. (See the first picture in the Lirc
article for a picture.) Thus, a IR carrier of 38kHz (which is fairly typical)
can be generated through a 19kHz audio signal, which is (as opposed to 38kHz)
within the realm of medium quality sound equipment, for example using mobile
devices.
</p>
<p>IrScrutinizer can generate these audio signals as wave files, which can be
exported from the export pane, or sent to the local computers sound card. There
are some settings available: Sample frequency (44100, 48000, 96000, 192000Hz),
sample size (8 or 16 bits) can be selected. Also "stereo" files can be
generated by selecting the number of channels to be 2. The use of this feature
is somewhat limited: it just generates another channel in opposite phase to the
first one, for hooking up the IR LEDs to the difference signal between the
left and the right channel. This will buy you double amplitude (6 dB) at the
cost of doubling the file sizes. If the possibility exists, it is better to
turn up the volume instead.
</p>
<!--p>Data can be generated in little-endian (default) or big-endian format. This
applies only to 16-bit sample sizes.</p>

<p>As an experimental option, the carrier frequency division as described above
can be turned off (the "Divide carrier" check-box). This is only meaningful for
sample frequencies of 96kHz and higher, and for "audio equipment" able to
reproduce frequencies like 36kHz and above.</p-->
<p>Most of "our" IR sequences ends with a period of silence almost for the half
of the total duration. By selecting the "Omit trailing gap"-option, this
trailing gap is left out of the generated data &ndash; it is just silence
anyhow. This is probably a good choice (almost) always.</p>

<!--p>Finally, the wave form on the modulation signal can be selected to either
sine or square wave. For practical usage, my experiments shown no real
performance difference.</p-->

<p>Note that when listening to music, higher sample rates, wider sample sizes,
and more channels sound better (in general). However, generating "audio" for
IR-LEDs is a completely different use case. The recommended settings are:
48000kHz, 8bit, 1 channel, omit trailing gap.</p>

<!--p>Note that the settings on this pane also take effect when exporting wave
files from the export pane.</p>
<p>By pressing "Get Line" a "line" to the audio system on the local computer is
allocated. This is actually superfluous, since the send-functions make this
automatically anyhow. It will possibly be removed in future versions.</p-->

<title>The "Capturing HW" pane</title>
<p>The sub-panes of this pane allow for the configuration of capturing
hardware. Selecting a sub-pane also selects the associated hardware,
if possible. The hardware can also be selected from the tool bar, Options -&gt;
Capturing hardware. In many cases, one piece of hardware can be used both for sending and
capturing. In these cases, it is in generaly opened and closed under the "Sending hw" pane,
but still needs to be selected for capturing.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately not possible to have e.g. one IrToy for sending and <em>another one</em>
for capturing.</p>

<p>Note that by e.g. selecting non-existing hardware or such, there is a
possibility encounter long delays, or even to "hang" the program.</p>

<p>After configuring and opening the capturing hardware, the "Test" button can be
used for testing the configuration without switching pane.</p>

<section><title>IrWidget</title>
<p>Plug the IrWidget it into the computer. Check that the operating system
has assigned a port to it, and note which one it is. On Windows: open the
device manager, and check that there is one "USB Serial Port" under Ports. Note
the port number (e.g. <code>COM8</code>). On a Linux system, it likely shows up as a device
like <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>. If the port does not show up, a suitable driver needs to be
installed. If the correct port is already visible in the combo box, just
press "Open". Otherwise, press "Refresh", which makes the program determine
the currently available serial ports. Select the correct one. Press "Open". which should
now remain "pressed". The port can be closed again by another press, but
there is not much reason to do so, unless another capturing hardware should be
used, or the IrWidget should be used from another program.</p>

    <title>Lirc Mode2</title>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/mode2.html">
        <code>mode2</code>
    </a> is a program from the Lirc distribution, that prints timing
information in a simple text format to standard output. (Note that in Lirc terminology,
    there are really <a href="Glossary.html#Mode2">three meanings</a> of the term "mode2".)
    IrScrutinizer can read a stream in this format, either on its standard input, or from a program
run in an internal subprocess. This way, effectively any Lirc mode2 driver can be used
to capture IR signals for Lirc (assuming "normal" modulation frequency).
This makes IrScrutinizer a viable replacement of the
<a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/irrecord.html">
        <code>irrecord</code>
    </a> program.
</p>

<section>
    <title>Standard input</title>
<p>To use with standard input, the program can be started for example with a command like</p>
<source>$ mode2 --driver default | irscrutinizer &amp; </source>
<p>As capturing device
"Lirc Mode 2" and the subpane "Standard input" is selected.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <title>Command in sub-process</title>
<p>In theory, any program
that prints information in the mode2 format can be used. The command line for the

stops the sub-process.</p>

<title>Command line arguments</title>
<p>Normal usage is just to double click on the jar-file, or possibly on
some wrapper invoking that jar file. However, there are some command
line arguments that can be useful either if invoking from the command
line, or in writing wrappers, or when configuring custom commands in
Windows. </p>

<p>Girr files given as command line argument will be imported to the "parametric remote" table.
    Accordingly, if the system is configured to associate <code>*.girr</code> with IrScrutinizer,
    these files can be opened by double clicking them.
</p>

<p>
The options <code>--version</code> and <code>--help</code> work as they are
expected to work in the <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Command_002dLine-Interfaces.html#Command_002dLine-Interfaces">GNU
coding standards for command line interfaces</a>. Use
the <code>--help</code>-command to see the complete list of command line parameters. The <code>-v/--verbose</code>
option set the verbose flag, causing commands like sending to IR
hardware printing some messages in the console.</p>

<p>The option <code>--nuke-properties</code> makes the program delete the property file, and exit immediately.</p>

<!--p>The second form invokes IrpMaster as a the command line program  on the rest
of the arguments. It is a convenience feature for just having one user entry
point
in the distributed jar file.</p-->

<p>For automating tasks, or for integrating in build processes or Makefiles or
the like, it
is probably a better idea to use IrpMaster instead, which has a
reasonably complete <a href="IrpMaster.html#Command+line+usage">command line interface</a>.</p>

<p>IrpMaster as command line program can be invoked with the AppImage installation by giving <code>--irpmaster</code>
as the <em>first</em> argument to the program; all of the rest will be handled over to IrpMaster.
However, the <code>--config</code> is not needed, it is generated automatically.</p>

<p>The MacOS App does not support calling IrpMaster; install the generic binary version if needed.</p>

<p>The program delivers well defined and sensible exit codes.</p>

<title>Questions and Answers</title>
<section><title>Does IrScrutinizer completely replaces IrMaster?</title>
<p>Almost. Using <a href='IrMaster.html#The+"IR+Protocols"+pane'>MakeHex as
renderer</a> (or more correctly, its Java version) instead of IrpMaster is not
implemented. (The practical usage of this feature is probably <em>very</em>
limited, and IrMaster is still available, should it ever be needed.) The
<a href='IrMaster.html#The+"War+Dialer"+pane'>"war dialer"</a> is also not
implemented, but see next question. For the wave export, some rarely used
options (the possibility to
select big-endian format (for 16-bit samples), the possibility <em>not</em> to
half the carrier frequency, and the possibility to select sine (instead of
square) for modulation) have been removed. Finally, there is some
stuff that simply works differently, like the export function.</p>
</section>
<section><title>How do I emulate the war dialer of IrMaster?</title>
<p>
Use "Scrutinize remote" -> Parametric Remote. Fill in the table with signals to
be tested, either using the pop-up button (right mouse in the table) Advanced ->
Add missing F's, or from the Generate pane, using suitable parameter
intervals (see <a href="#The+%22Generate%22+pane">this</a>), and transfer them using the "To parametric remote" button. Then
test the candidate signals one at a time by transmit-ting them, using suitable
sending hardware.
The comment field, or the "verified" check-box, can be used for note taking.</p>

<p>A "war dialer" like in IrMaster may be implemented in a later version.
</p>
</section>
<section><title>Can I use this program for
conveniently controlling my favorite IR controlled device from the sofa?</title>
<p>No, the program is not meant for that. While you definitely can assemble a
"remote" on the "scrutinize remote" panel, and transmit the different commands
with mouse commands (appropriate hardware assumed), the program is intended for
developing codes for other deployment solutions.
</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/JGirs">JGirs</a>,
    which is an IR server implementing the <a href="Girs.html">Girs</a> specification.
    It can be considered as "IrScrutinizer as a server".
</p>
</section>
<section><title>The pane interface sucks.</title>
<p>Yes.  There are several use cases when the
user would like to see several "panes" simultaneously. Also, it should be
possible to have several windows of the same sort (like the "scrutinize
signal") simultaneously. Replacing the top level panes with something
"Eclipse-like"
(sub-windows that can be rearranged, resized, moved, iconized) is on my
wish list.

<title>I did something funny, and now the program does not startup, with no

<p>Try deleting the <a href="#Properties">properties file</a>.
(Note the command line option <code>--nuke-properties</code> which will do exactly that,
without having to manually find the file or its name.) If that does not help, try

gracefully "unsteal" file associations.)</p></section>

<section><title>(Windows) Why is the program so slow at start-up?</title>
<p>Normal start up time is a few seconds, about the same time as it
takes for (e.g.) a web browser to start. If it takes considerably
longer than that, the problem is almost surely hardware related, i.e., the
program looks for possibly non-existant hardware. To fix this, make
sure that the selected capture- and sending devices (these are save
between sessions!) do not correspond to something non-existant. The
most "innocent" settings are: capture: Lirc mode 2, and sending:
Audio port. These are also the defaults when the program starts up for
the first time. Also, consider deleting possible
    "junk devices" in the Windows device manager under <code>COM &amp; LPT</code>
    (unused Bluetooth-to-serial ports etc.). </p>

<section><title>(Linux) I get error messages that lock files cannot be
created, and then the Arduino and IrToy hardware do not
work.</title><p>
When starting IrScrutinizer, or by pressing the "Refresh" button,
error messages occur like</p>
<p>
<code>
check_group_uucp(): error testing lock file creation Error
details:Permission deniedcheck_lock_status: No permission to create
lock file.
</code>
</p>
<p>
(and a number of them...)
The problem is that the library <code>rxtx</code> (like some other program
accessing a serial interface) wants to create a lock file in a
particular directory. This is/was traditionally
<code>/var/lock</code>, which is often a symbolic link to
<code>/var/run/lock</code>. This directory is normally writable by
members of the group <code>lock</code>. So your user-account should probably
be a member of that group. (How to perform this is different in
different Linux distributions.) The rxtx library delivered with
IrScrutinizer expects the lock directory to be
<code>/var/lock</code>. However, recently some Linux-distributions
(e.g. Fedora 20), instead are using <code>/var/lock/lockdev</code> as
its lock directory (while <code>/var/lock</code> still is a link to
<code>/var/run/lock</code>. To solve this, I recommend, if possible,
installing rxtx provided by the Linux distribution used, i.e. not
using the one with IrScrutinizer. For example, on Fedora, the command
is
</p>
<source>
sudo dnf install rxtx
</source>
<p>which installs the library in <code>/usr/lib/rxtx</code> or
<code>/usr/lib64/rxtx</code>, depending on the operating system. (Other distributions uses other
commands, for example <code>apt-get</code> on Debian-like systems.)
Finally, the correct installation directory of the library
(<code>librxtxSerial-2.2pre1.so</code>) has to be given to the JVM
running IrScrutinizer. For this, see the wrapper
<code>irscrutinizer.sh</code> and the comments therein, and make the
necessary adaptations.

    <title>Appendix. Building from sources</title>
    <p>"IrScrutinizer" is one subproject (corresponding to a Java <em>package</em>) within <a href="http://harctoolbox.org">harctoolbox.org</a>.
    It depends on several other subprojects within harctoolbox. The project <code>harctoolboxbundle</code> consists
    of these subproject bundled together, with some dependent third-party components added.</p>

    <p>The released versions are found on the <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/harctoolboxbundle/releases">download page</a>.
    The development sources are maintained on <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/harctoolboxbundle">my GitHub repository</a>.
    Forking and pull requests are welcome!</p>
<section>
    <title>Dependencies</title>
<p>
As any program of substantial size, IrScrutinizer uses a number of third-party components.
    All of these are also free software, carrying compatible licenses.
The dependent packages need to be installed also in
    maven in order for the build to work. With the dependencies available, the script <code>tools/install-deps.sh</code>
can be used to install  them in the local maven repository before building.</p>

<!--p>Presently, Fedora RPMs are available for all dependencies.</p-->

        <title>DevSlashLirc</title>
        <p>This library is used to access <code>/dev/lirc</code>-hardware. It is used by the Linux version only.
        It is a Java JNI library, written in Java and C++. It is written by myself,
        and available <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/DevSlashLirc">here</a>.

    <section>
        <title>The Crystal icons</title>
        <p>A subset of the Crystal icons are included, and will be included in a built jar.
    Most Linux distributions contain these too, so a Linux packaging may like to use the system icons instead.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>RXTX</title>
<p>The serial communication packate RXTX is also included in the source package. This builds a shared library and a jar file.
    If there is a system supported RXTX (<code>librxtxSerial</code> really), it should be preferred.
    The distribution constains pre-compiled binaries for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X, both in 32- and 64-bit versions.
    To compile the C sources, see the sub-directory <code>rxtx-pre2h</code> and the instructions therein.</p>

    <p>Note that the system supplied RXTX jar on many system (e.g. Fedora 21) has some issues
        (version number incompatible with the shared library, does not recognize
        the <code>/dev/ttyACM*</code>-ports required by IrToy and many Arduinos, unflexible library loading),
        so using our RXTX jar together with the system supplied shared library can be sensible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>DecodeIR</title>
        <p>If the system supports DecodeIR, use the system version. On recent Fedora, this can be installed with the command
            <code>sudo dnf install DecodeIR</code>. This will install both the shared
            library <code>libDecodeIR</code> as well as the jar file <code>DecodeIrCaller.jar</code>.
To download and compile the sources, see (or execute) the script <code>tools/build-decodeir.sh</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>ExchangeIR</title>
        <p>It the system supports ExchangeIR, use the system version. (On recent Fedora, use <code>sudo dnf install ExchangeIR</code>.)
        Otherwise, it can be downloaded and installed by the script <code>tools/build-exchangeir.sh</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>minimal-json</title>
        <p>It the system supports minimal-json, use the system version. (On recent Fedora, use <code>sudo dnf install minimal-json</code>.)
        Otherwise, it can be downloaded and installed by the script <code>tools/build-minimal-json.sh</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>jcommander</title>
        <p>It the system supports jcommander, use the system version. (On recent Fedora, use <code>sudo dnf install beust-jcommander</code>.)
        Otherwise, it can be downloaded and installed by the script <code>tools/build-jcommander.sh</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Tonto</title>
        <p>It the system support Tonto, use the system version. (On recent Fedora, use <code>sudo dnf install tonto</code>.)
        Otherwise, it can be downloaded and installed by the script <code>tools/build-tonto.sh</code>.</p>

        <p>Note that the shared library <code>libjnijcomm</code>,
        which is required by the program Tonto for communicating with a Pronto remote through a serial interface,
        is not required for use with IrScrutinizer, and can therefore be left out.</p>

<section>
    <title>Building</title>
    <p>As of version 1.1.2, the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/index.html">Maven</a> "software
project management and comprehension tool" is used as building system.
Modern IDEs like Netbeans and Eclips integrate Maven, so build etc can be initiated from the IDE.
Of course, the shell command <code>mvn install</code> can also be used. It creates some artifacts which can
be used to run IrScrutinizer in the <code>IrScrutinizer/target</code> directory.</p>
<p>It also creates a <code>package/dist</code> directory containing jars
(without dependencies), docs, and configurations files. This is intended to support
packaging.</p>

<p>To prepare the Windows version, some shell tools are needed. These are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <code>unix2dos</code> and <code>dos2unix</code> utilities, typically in the <code>dos2unix</code> package.</li>
    <li>The <code>icotool</code> utility, typically in the <code>icoutils</code> package</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <title>Windows setup.exe creation</title>
    <p>For building the Windows setup.exe, the <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/download.php/is.exe">Inno Installer version 5</a>
    is needed. To build the Windows <code>setup.exe</code> file, preferrably the work area should
be mounted on a Windows computer. Then, on the Windows computer, open
        the generated file <code>IrScrutinizer/target/IrScrutinizer_inno.iss</code> with
        the Inno installer, and start the compile. This will generate the desired file
    <code>IrScutinizer-</code><em><code>version</code></em><code>.exe</code>.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the "compatibility layer capable of running
    Windows applications" software application <a
    href="https://www.winehq.org">Wine</a> (included in most Linux
    distributions) can run the ISCC compiler of Inno. The Maven file
    <code>IrScrutinizer/pom.xml</code> contains an experimental
    invocation along these lines.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <title>Mac OS X app creation</title>
    <p>The Maven build creates a file
<code>IrScrutinizer-</code><em><code>version</code></em><code>-app.zip</code>.
This file can be directly distributed to the users, to be installed according to
<a href="#Mac+OS+X+app">these instructions</a>.</p>

<p>The icon file <code>IrScrutinizer.icns</code> was produced from the Crystal-Clear
icon <code>babelfish.png</code> in 128x128 resolution, using the procedure
described
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11770806/why-doesnt-icon-composer-2-4-support-the-1024x1024-size-icon-any-more">here</a>.
        </p>
</section>

<section>
    <title>Test invocation</title>
    <p>For testing purposes, the programs can be invoked from their different target directories.
        IrScrutinizer can be invoked as</p>
<source>$ cd IrScrutinizer
    $ java -jar target/IrScrutinizer-jar-with-dependencies.jar
</source>
<p>and IrpMaster as</p>
    <source>$ cd IrpMaster
    $ java -jar target/IrpMaster-jar-with-dependencies.jar <em>[arguments...]</em>
    </source>
<p>IrScrutinizer can also be started by double clicking the mentioned jar file,
    provided that the desktop has been configured to start executable jar with "java".</p>
</section>

<section>
    <title>Installation</title>
    <p>For reasons unclear to me, Maven does not support something like <code>make install</code> for installing a
    recently build program on the local host. Instead, the supplied script <code>tools/install-irscrutinizer.sh</code>
    installs the program to normal Linux/autotools locations.
    (Actually, invoking Maven with the "deploy" target will invoke this script too.)
    Alternativelly, the just created generic-binary package
    (<code>IrScrutinizer/target/IrScrutinizer-bin.zip</code>) can be installed using <a href="#Generic+Binary">these instuctions</a>.</p>
