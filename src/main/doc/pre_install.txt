Welcome to IrScrutinizer, a program for capturing, generating,
analyzing, importing, and exporting of IR signals.

Select the option "Add installation directory to path" to be able to
call the command line program IrpMaster directly from a command window.

Installing this program requires administrator right only of writing
to directories that require such rights. No registry entries are made
or modified. Except for shortcuts and menu entries, nothing is
installed outside of the application directory.

If the user is in the administrator group, installation will be made
as administrator. Otherwise, the installer will run as normal
user. In that case, be sure to select an installation directory that is
writeable/creatable by the current user.

Warning: Sending undocumented IR commands to your equipment may damage
or even destroy it. By using this program, you agree to take the
responsibility for possible damages yourself, and not to hold the
author responsible.
