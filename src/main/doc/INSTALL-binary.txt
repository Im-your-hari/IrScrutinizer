This is the generic binary distribution of IrScrutinizer. It runs on
Linux (including Raspberry Pi), Windows, Macs,
and probably on other similar systems as well.

Users of 64-bit Linux (that is almost all Linux systems on PCs today)
can alternatively use the AppImage version, since it requres no installation.
Windows users probably prefers using the Windows setup.exe.
Mac OS users are recommended to use the app version.

In all cases, a Java 8 or later needs to be installed first.

To install, unpack in an empty directory of your choice, suggested is
/usr/local/irscrutinizer. Inspect the wrapper irscrutinizer.sh, and
make changes if necessary.

It is recommended to make links from a directory in the path to the
wrapper script, e.g.

ln -s /usr/local/irscrutinizer/irscrutinizer.sh /usr/local/bin/irscrutinizer
ln -s /usr/local/irscrutinizer/irscrutinizer.sh /usr/local/bin/irpmaster

If your system supports the RXTX, you should preferably use that. See
the comments in the wrapper irscrutinizer.sh.

The JNI library libDecodeIR.so/DecodeIR.dll is contained in the
distribution and should be found without problems.

The desktop file irscrutinizer.desktop should, if desired, be
installed in /usr/local/share/applications alternatively
~/.local/share/applications.
The same goes for girr.xml, describing the Girr file type.
