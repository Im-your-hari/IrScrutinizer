This the subdirectories of this directory contains compiled shared
libraries for different systems.

Linux users are strongly encouraged to use librxtxSerial.so supplied
by their Linux distribution, if possible -- it (should) manage file
locking etc. compatible with the rest of the distro.

Mac users: note that the default file extension for JNI libraries
changed lately (by OS X 10.9?) from .jnilib to .dylib.
