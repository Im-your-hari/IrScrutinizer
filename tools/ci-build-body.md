Files Contained:
\n
The .md5, .sha1, sha512 files are different checksums, that can be used for checking the integrity of a downloaded file, if deemed necessary. 
\n
* The x86_64.AppImage is an AppImage that can be run on 64-bit Intel Linux-es. Just download, make executable, and double click. Contains its own Java.
* The macOS.dmg are for use on Mac OS X. Download, mount; the IrScrutinizer app is found there. This can be double clicked directly, and, optionally, copied to Applications directory and/or the system tray. Comes with its own Java.
* The bin.zip file is the generic binary distribution for use when the previous ones are not desired or possible. Does _not_ come with included Java.
\n
For technical reasons, there is no Windows setup.exe files in the CI build. Windows users can just unpack the generic binary distribution in the installation directory.
